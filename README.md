# ML_baseline_pred_code

To import the val.prob.ci.2 function, import the "auc.nonpara.mw", "ci.auc", and "val.prob.ci.2" codes.

The "ll.calc" code is to import the log-likelihood calculate function to be used in the train function.

The "script_ml_pred" code is the main code. 
The cv_perstudy.R and cv_10x.R are the code to train and validate the models.
